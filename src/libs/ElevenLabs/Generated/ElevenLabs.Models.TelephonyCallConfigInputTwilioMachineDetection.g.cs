    /// Configuration for Twilio's carrier-level answering machine detection (AMD). Omit or set to null to disable it. Ignored for non-Twilio providers and for inbound calls. The resulting verdict is delivered as its own `answering_machine_detection` webhook event, which requires that event to be enabled on the workspace or agent webhook settings; it is not part of the conversation or the post-call webhook. Detection runs asynchronously so it never delays the start of the conversation, and the verdict can arrive at any point during the call -- with `detect_message_end`, even after it has ended. Twilio bills separately for AMD.
