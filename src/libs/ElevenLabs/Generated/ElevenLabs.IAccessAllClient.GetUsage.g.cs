The response is a tabular structure with columns, column_types, column_units, and rows, with one row per group and bucket. `total_cost` is the cost in the workspace's currency and `total_charge_count` the billed quantity. Usage can be grouped or filtered by at most two of `user_id`, `hashed_xi_api_key`, `region`, `reporting_workspace_id`, `billing_group_id`, `product_type`, `surface` and `actor`, and grouping by two of them requires an `eq` or `in` filter on one. `model`, `request_source`, `fiat_charge_type` and `fiat_currency` can always be added. Some id columns also get a display-name column, such as user_label, appended after the existing columns. Workspaces billed in credits should use /v1/workspace/analytics/query/usage-by-product-over-time.
